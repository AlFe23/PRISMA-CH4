# PRISMA-CH4
This repository contains the code and resources for detecting and quantifying methane (CH4) emissions using PRISMA hyperspectral satellite imagery. The methodology utilizes the Cluster Tuned Matched Filter (CTMF) and a lookup table (LUT) to automate the generation of unit absorption spectra.
