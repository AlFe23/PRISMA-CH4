# PRISMA-CH4
This repository contains the code and resources for detecting and quantifying methane (CH4) emissions using PRISMA hyperspectral satellite imagery. 

The methodology, originally developed for CLEAR-UP project funded by ASI, leverages PRISMA Hyperspectral sensor to monitor methane emissions using an enhanced matched filter technique known as the Cluster Tuned Matched Filter (CTMF), applied to L1C radiance images. The unit absorption spectrum, obtained using multiple MODTRAN6Â® simulations, serves as the target in the matched filter, enabling methane detection and quantification. Key steps include utilizing PRISMA L1C radiance images in the 2300 nm short-wave infrared methane absorption window, adapting the matched filter to account for background clutter, and applying clustering for refined background spectrum calculations. Methane concentration is estimated by linearizing the Beer-Lambert absorption law and using the unit absorption spectrum, which represents the unit methane absorption as a function of wavelength. Automation through a lookup table (LUT) based on precomputed radiances for various conditions enables real-time applicability. Results computed over 200 PRISMA acquisitions revealed methane plumes at various sites of interest in countries including Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Turkmenistan, and the USA. For instance, the Natural Gas compression plant in Kamyshlydzha, Turkmenistan, consistently exhibited methane plumes across all 13 images analyzed. Several large landfills were examined using available PRISMA images or through specific acquisition requests. Evidence of methane concentration enhancement was observed in the Buenos Aires landfill and the Pirana landfill in Ahmedabad.
